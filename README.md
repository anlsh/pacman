# pacman
PacMan written in python for my comsci final project

Please run with Python 3+. The program is incompatible with Python 2 due to differences in how calls to `super()` are handled between the two versions.

To run the program, simply execute `driver.py` like so: `python driver.py`

Dependencies
-------------
`pyglet` - This library can easily be installed using `pip`
